    Adjusted Mutual Information (AMI) is an adjustment of the Mutual
    Information (MI) score to account for chance. It accounts for the fact that
    the MI is generally higher for two clusterings with a larger number of
    clusters, regardless of whether there is actually more information shared.
    For two clusterings :math:`U` and :math:`V`, the AMI is given as::

        AMI(U, V) = [MI(U, V) - E(MI(U, V))] / [max(H(U), H(V)) - E(MI(U, V))]

    This metric is independent of the absolute values of the labels:
    a permutation of the class or cluster label values won't change the
    score value in any way.

    This metric is furthermore symmetric: switching ``label_true`` with
    ``label_pred`` will return the same score value. This can be useful to
    measure the agreement of two independent label assignments strategies
    on the same dataset when the real ground truth is not known.

    Be mindful that this function is an order of magnitude slower than other
    metrics, such as the Adjusted Rand Index.
